# Dynamic-Hypersphere-Algorithm-for-Classification

# Abstract: 
  In pattern recognition, samples are directly classified in the feature space or mapped to higher dimensional spaces by kernel functions. In order to improve the classification effect, the following methods are commonly used:1. Solve for better separation surface; 2. More efficient feature space. This paper proposes a Dynamic Hypersphere Algorithm (DHA)  for classification that can find a more efficient feature space. DHA uses dynamic feature transformation and optimizes the same type of data into the same hypersphere. This paper proves that DHA can obtain better classification results by finding effective feature space by experimenting on standard data sets. In addition, in order to further prove the validity of the feature space, In this paper, DHA is applied to the MNIST handwriting by reducing the training samples and reducing the original sample 784 to 10 dimensions, a recognition rate of 90.18% is obtained, and good results are also obtained in the unbalanced handwriting.
